I'm a Senior Developer Advocate at [AWS Amplify](https://amplify.aws/) focusing on fullstack serverless web applications. I do a lot of [speaking on React and Svelte](https://www.swyx.io/speaking/) and write both nontechnical and technical reflections updated on [my weekly-ish newsletter](https://tinyletter.com/swyx). I recently published   <a href="https://learninpublic.org/?from=GH%20README">The Coding Career Handbook</a> to write down all the tacit knowledge that helps people succeed in our industry!!
